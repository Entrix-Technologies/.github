## 🌍 Who We Are

Entrix Technologies is a UK-based software studio built on a simple belief:

**Good technology should be secure, thoughtful, and genuinely helpful.**

We focus on creating tools and systems that support developers, creators, and cyber professionals without sacrificing privacy, sustainability, or user experience.

We care deeply about:

- Clear, honest engineering  
- Practical problem solving  
- Accessible, intuitive design  
- User privacy and control  
- Ethical and sustainable technology  

Entrix is built by people who love technology and want to make it better — not louder.

## 🌟 Our Core Values

### **1. Security Without Compromise**  
Security is not a feature — it’s the foundation.  
We take a careful, privacy-respecting approach to everything we design.

### **2. Simplicity Through Thoughtfulness**  
Complex tools don’t need to feel complicated.  
We aim for clarity, clean design, and a frictionless experience.

### **3. Respect for the User**  
No data harvesting.  
No hidden agendas.  
No unnecessary intrusions.  
Users should always feel in control of their tools.

### **4. Sustainable & Ethical Engineering**  
We design systems that last, that run efficiently, and that respect the world around us.

### **5. Transparency Where It Matters**  
We share knowledge, documentation, and guidelines openly — while keeping sensitive systems protected.

### **6. Continuous Learning & Improvement**  
We stay curious, keep experimenting, and try to make each version better than the last.
